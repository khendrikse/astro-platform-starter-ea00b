*Monstera deliciosa*, commonly known as the Swiss Cheese Plant, is a popular tropical houseplant prized for its large, perforated leaves. Follow these care tips to keep your Monstera thriving:

**1. Light:** Provide bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves.

**2. Watering:** Water when the top 2 inches of soil feel dry. Do not let the plant sit in standing water to prevent root rot.

**3. Humidity:** Monstera prefers higher humidity. Mist the leaves occasionally or use a humidifier.

**4. Soil & Drainage:** Use a well-drasdfdsfining potting mix and a pot with drainage holes.

**5. Feeding:** Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced houseplant fertilizer.

**6. Pruning & Support:** Trim yellow or damaged leaves and provide a moss pole or trellis for support as the vines grow.

Enjoy watching your Monstera develop those iconic leaves!sdfdsf
